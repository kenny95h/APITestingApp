### Good 

- Worked well as team to get API working correctly
- Not giving up when facing hurdles, specifically authorization process

### Bad

- Deciding to work with an API that requires a convoluted authorization
- Better project board development at start

### Takeaway Notes 

- Explore the API more 
- Choice: Investigate more before jumping in to an API that requires OAuth authorization
